  * 2009-01-26 install docs
  
  - Added greatly to INSTALL.pod, at the same time actually developing a more coherent install strategy.
  - New utils push.pl and scan.pl
  - got rid of some dirs users/ and admin/, in favor of worker_dotssh/ and root_dotssh/.

  * 2009-01-25 RC
  
  - Replaced host shuffling with consistent hashing for determining preferred order of responsibility. Host shuffling is still used for randomizing order of fragment aggregation before reduces, to spread load.

  * exec parallel commands
  
  Execute parallel commands with no input corpus but with a result corpus.
  
  This may be the basis for much more efficient seating and copy/append/delete of corpora.
  
  - no documentation yet
  - no tests yet (bad)

  * 2008-12-22
  
  - consolidation of ct and tt executables into 'robots' executable completed
  - added optional compression corpus attribute for easier shadow corpora support
  - added rsync'd execution contexts in map/mapreduce separate from result corpus hierarchy
  - added explicit sync of current dir on master as mirrored execution context
  - removed diskfree, too specific and easy to use eg "cmd 'df -sh repos'" instead
  
  

Sun Dec  7 11:33:54 PST 2008  ira@h5.com
  * improved ctlist func
  
  - made new functionality for "list", calling "list [corpus]" lists that corpus and all shadow corpora for it.

Wed Nov 19 19:06:53 PST 2008  ira@h5.com
  * robots!
  
  Both ct and tt are consolidated into a single executable, "robots".
  
  Soon both ct.conf and tt.conf will also be consolidated (into robots.conf?)
  
  Pod documentation is held over from both previous programs. This will be restructured into an online help system like that of darcs.
