Things on the roadmap. You can help out with any of these.


- A spiffy new retro-style logo for the Robot Army. Include the motto "E Pluribus Machina"

- Create/revise documentation 
  - Elevator pitch / abstract
  - Help texts in bin/robots
  - User Guide
    - operations: map, mapreduce, exec, cmd, 
    - corpus tool funcs
  - Install/Admin Guide
    - adding users
    - adding machines
    - creating clusters
    - installing software on workers

- Suggest design improvements



Bugs:

- Since viral infrastructure installs, partial logs from the originating host get copied along with the rest of the sandbox. This causes cat of [log] shadow corpora to be incomplete when a truncated log is the one chosen in the stream view.

- make ttstatus more cpu efficient, it gets pegged during reduces by repeatedly having to serialize *long* lists. This is causing slowdown no doubt about it.

- no space left on device should be handled more smoothly

- add at least one test for exec op in t/TT.t

- refactor bin/robots ttmap/ttexec/ttmapreduce and the corresponding monitor() funcs, these are highly pasted.

- clean up corpus creation semantics. What a mess.

- shadow corpora on exec op are invisible

- reimplement configuration to use .robotsrc, conf/robotsrc (and cmdline opts) rather than cont/ct.conf, conf/tt.conf. Goal is to have single config file, which will require renaming some things. For instance, record separator options for input/output.

- prove the completeness of operations (new reduce phase not yet proven)


Features:

- Job control 
  o kill jobs virally
  o add / subtract processes
  o record the user program's pid somewhere to facilitate this

- A quick diagnostic task to speedily verify which robots are ready via exec op possibly
  o Note: some important files that should be checked (possibly via cksum)
   ~/.ssh/known_hosts
   ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ~/.ssh/ oh hell just everything here
   /etc/make.conf <- for the GENTOO_MIRRORS and SYNC entries
   /etc/hosts
   /etc/fstab
  o ALSO: important libraries should be checked, like Compress::LZO and Text::Scan.
    - note perl's compilation failed return code is 2.


- A "reversion map" visual display of chunks vs machines indicating possible causes (data or environment) of reversions.

- preaggregation option in transitive mapreduce operation

- configurable compression schemes [gzip,lzo,lzma] for kv records and flat txt chunks.

- an fsck for rings (deeper than 'check')

- new operation: merge. Takes two kv corpora with compatible keys and passes each corresponding pair of records/chunks to the user program.

- new operation: matrix. Takes two corpora and passes every (m*n) pair of records/chunks to the user program. Expensive but powerful.
