Things on the roadmap. You can help out with any of these.


- A spiffy new retro-style logo for the Robot Army. Include the motto "E Pluribus Machina"

- Create/revise documentation (Help texts in bin/robots, the Install Guide, the User Guide, the Admin Guide).

- Suggest design improvements

- Rewrite the partitioner to base it on a high-performance data structure like a radix trie or something. This will give at least ~20% speed improvement.
